This repository will contain python implementations of common machine learning algorithams.

decision tree:
     algorithams are adapted from machin learning mastery website @ https://machinelearningmastery.com/implement-random-forest-scratch-python/ and https://machinelearningmastery.com/implement-decision-tree-algorithm-scratch-python/
     
     basic decision tree with 2 measures - gini index and log entropy
     random forest
