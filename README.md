This repository will contain python implementations of common machine learning algorithams.

decision tree:
     algorithams are taken from machin learning masters @ https://machinelearningmastery.com/implement-random-forest-scratch-python/
     and https://machinelearningmastery.com/implement-decision-tree-algorithm-scratch-python/
     basic decision tree with 2 measures - gini index and log entropy
     random forest
